// Write a program that uses a fan out pattern to generate 100 random numbers
// concurrently. Have each goroutine generate a single random number and return
// that number to the main goroutine over a buffered channel. Set the size of
// the buffer channel so no send every blocks. Don't allocate more buffers than
// you need. Have the main goroutine display each random number is receives and
// then terminate the program.
package main

import (
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

const (
	goroutines = 100
)

func init() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
}

func main() {
	// Create the buffer channel with a buffer for
	// each goroutine to be created.

	// Iterate and launch each goroutine.

	// Create an anonymous function for each goroutine that
	// generates a random number and sends it on the channel.

	rand.Intn(100)

	// Create a variable to be used to track received messages.
	// Set the value to the number of goroutines created.

	// Iterate receiving each value until they are all received.
	// Store them in a slice of ints.

	// Print the values in our slice.
