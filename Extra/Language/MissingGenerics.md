Generics have been accepted and will be included in upcoming Go versions.

A couple of notes:

* There are code generators that may help, e.g. [https://github.com/cheekybits/genny](https://github.com/cheekybits/genny)
* If you find using empty interfaces - `interface{}` - a lot, you lose the benefits of static typing.
* Go is not perfect for everything, do not try to force it.
