# Reading Code

A few example projects which I consider to be "code reading" projects.

* [golang/go](https://github.com/golang/go/)
* [go4org/go4](https://github.com/go4org/go4/)
* [perkeep/perkeep](https://github.com/perkeep/perkeep)
* [upspin/upspin](https://github.com/upspin/upspin)
* [influxdata/influxdb](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb)
