languages in which programs are expressed, the action of assignment is familiar
and well understood. In fact, any change of the internal state of a machine
executing a program can be modeled as an assignment of a new value to some
variable part of that machine. However, the operations of input and output,
which affect the external environment of a machine, are not nearly so well
understood. They are often added to a programming language only as an
afterthought.
