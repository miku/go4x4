## Contructors

[Does Go support function overloading?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6986944/does-the-go-language-have-function-method-overloading)

> No it does not.

When faced with the decision of providing a constructor for a type, these are
the most common approaches - using a hypothetical `Store` implemented in a package
`store`:

### Constructor variants

* store.New(...) Store
* store.New(...) (Store, error)
* store.NewStore(...) (Store, error) 
* store.NewCapacity(...) ...
* store.NewCapacityTimeout(...) ...

This is fine for simple case, few variants, but unwieldy for many options.

### Using separate options

Define a separate `Opts` struct with the options you want to pass to the
constructor.

* store.New(opts Opts) (Store, error)

* [https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/sdk/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/sdk/)

```go
reader, err := cli.ImagePull(ctx, "docker.io/library/alpine", types.ImagePullOptions{})
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
io.Copy(os.Stdout, reader)
```

### Functional Options Pattern

## Composition over inheritance

> The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.

There are no type hierarchies in Go.

Example of providing a varienty of implementations using interfaces:

* [https://pkg.go.dev/image#Image](https://pkg.go.dev/image#Image)

Notes:

* `image.Image` is an interface, containing three methods, which themselves can be interfaces
* there are a couple of implementation in subdirectories, e.g. jpg, png, ...
